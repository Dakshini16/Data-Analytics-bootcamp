Data Analysis Bootcamp - Day 5  
ðŸ“–Task 1: Word Cloud Generation  
What I Learned:
- Explored text data visualization using Word Clouds.  
- Understood the importance of word frequency in text analysis.  
Challenges Faced:  
- Removing irrelevant words and stopwords from the dataset.  
- Ensuring the Word Cloud accurately represents key terms.  
Output:  
âœ” A word cloud visualization highlighting frequently used words in cricket commentary.  
ðŸ“–Task 2: Cricket Score Trend Analysis (Line Chart): 
What I Learned: 
- Analyzed scoring patterns over time using line charts.  
- Understood how runs per over impact match momentum.  
Challenges Faced: 
- Extracting and structuring data for visualization.  
- Selecting the best visualization techniques for trend analysis.  
Output: 
âœ” A line chart displaying the trend of runs scored over different overs.  
ðŸ“–Task 3: TF-IDF Implementation from Scratch  
What I Learned: 
- Understood how Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) works in text analysis.  
- Implemented TF-IDF manually to understand mathematical calculations behind it.  
Challenges Faced: 
- Computing TF-IDF scores without using libraries like `scikit-learn`.  
- Handling large text datasets efficiently.  
Output: 
âœ” A manual implementation of TF-IDF**, verified using `TfidfVectorizer`.  
ðŸ“–Task 4: Comparing Manual TF-IDF with Scikit-learn  
What I Learned: 
- Understood how automated feature extraction works in NLP.  
- Compared manual calculations with `TfidfVectorizer` to check accuracy.  
Challenges Faced: 
- Ensuring manual calculations match scikit-learnâ€™s results.  
- Optimizing the code performance for large datasets.  
Output:  
âœ” A comparison report between manual and scikit-learn-based TF-IDF.  
Insights from Text Data  
What I Learned:  
- Extracted meaningful insights from cricket commentary using NLP.  
- Understood how text analysis contributes to sports analytics.  
Challenges Faced:  
- Converting raw text into structured insights.  
- Identifying important keywords from cricket commentary.  
Output: 
âœ” A report summarizing key insights from the text data.
 Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard  
What I Learned:  
- Created an interactive dashboard for cricket commentary and score analysis.  
- Used Streamlit/Plotly for real-time visualization.  
Challenges Faced:
- Optimizing the dashboard for large datasets.  
- Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface.  
Output:  
âœ” A fully functional interactive dashboard for cricket analytics.
